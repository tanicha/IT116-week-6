        <p>
            I am 18 years old. I recently just graduated from high 
            school and community college with both my diploma and my associates of arts degree. 
            Currently, I am in a program called year up which is a 6 month training program that specializes 
            in preparing young adults for their future careers consisting of jobs in the technical and business 
            field. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Prior to Year Up, I had only worked in customer service as my part-time job, starting out at age 16. 
            In the beginning of this year, I had the privilege of becoming a team lead at my current employment which has given me
            incredible insight on managing a team and creating an environment that can work efficiently together.
        </p>
        <p>
            The team member I most relate to is known as the productive dynamo. We tend to focus on getting things done and enjoy achieving goals. 
            This helps my team to complete all projects by the deadline and can motivate others to work hard as well. 
            I want to help my team stay motivated and give our very best on the job.
        </p>
